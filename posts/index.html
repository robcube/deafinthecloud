Let&rsquo;s start by asking what is Apache Airflow and why it plays an important part in automating the data flow in your business? Airflow is a standardized tool and framework that gives you visibility to your data flow end-to-end from ingestion to output (or multiple times over). It has a great graphical view showing users status of each workflow called DAG (Directed Acyclic Graphs).</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/disability-in-conference/ class="link black dim">Attending the Disability:IN Conference 2020 (virtually)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Was about to head to Chicago for the Disability:IN conference, however due to the pandemic, the conference is now held virtually. While the number of speakers and plenaries may not be as great as if it was held in person, it still looks like a great lineup of speakers and companies making their presence known, in other words, holding up their &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Hiring!&rdquo; signs.
DAY ONE Started off with some words of encouragement for companies to join the Disability Equality Index also known as the DEI.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/troubleshooting-aws-deployments/ class="link black dim">Troubleshooting Aws Deployments</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Deaf in the Cloud hosted by Robert Koch presents Troubleshooting AWS Deployments with Darren Weiner. Imagine for a minute you&rsquo;re working with a cloud provider and provisioning features left and right; all of a sudden someone else runs a cloud formation script and broke something! We will do a deep-dive into a typical AWS VPC design and discussing well-architected designs. There&rsquo;ll be a live demostration, and if you have your own AWS account, you can follow along.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/jefferson-frank-project/ class="link black dim">Participating in a Jefferson Frank whitepaper project</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Global leading AWS recruiter, Jefferson Frank, recently got in touch with me about an opportunity for an important project they were working on. In response to the Covid-19 crisis, they have collated expert advice from leading AWS Heroes and professionals into an industry whitepaper, of which I am proud to say I am part of.
The whitepaper covers five common challenges many are struggling with at this moment: cost saving, data security, remote working, growing at scale, and business continuity.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/using-c-sharp-with-aws/ class="link black dim">Using C# With AWS</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction I&rsquo;m doing a series on how C# works with AWS databases. AWS has 12 different databases all under different categories.

If you REALLY want it done in Python too, I can do that for you.
Database Types Use cases AWS service Relational Traditional applications, ERP, CRM, e-commerce Aurora, RDS, RedShift [NoSQL](#NoSQL) High-traffic web apps, e-commerce systems, gaming applications, content management, catalogs, user profiles DynamoDB, DocumentDB In-memory Coming soon.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/taking-online-exam/ class="link black dim">Taking the AWS Certificate Exam Online</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was about to schedule an AWS certification exam when everything was on hold due to the desire to maintain social distancing and keeping everyone healthy and safe. Regardless of your views, it&rsquo;s important to play it safe rather than risking our lives especially when there are many unknowns involving COVID-19. In light of the situtation, it&rsquo;s understandable that all exam centers were closed.
When I heard that AWS Training & Certifications in partnership with Pearson VUE had announced they will open up online testing, I immediately booked an exam two weeks out!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/speed-of-data/ class="link black dim">Speed of Data</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this topic for quite some time and while I&rsquo;m putting this into this blog, it is a small part of a larger discussion.

Accuracy of the data is a business necessity and we have many ways to do this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/reinvent-2019/ class="link black dim">re:Invent 2019</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Venetian, Las Vegas, Nevada December 1-6
What. A. Week! That pretty much sums it up. This was my third re:Invent, first as a AWS Data Hero. The week started with the flight in, and it&rsquo;s been pretty much non-stop from there. On the flight home, I actually nodded off, and I&rsquo;m the type of person who cannot sleep while moving. That&rsquo;s in addition to returning from a long vacation driving across western states bypassing a snowstorm and high winds for two days just to get home to make my Las Vegas flight the next day.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/developers-influencers-summit/ class="link black dim">Developers Influencers Summit</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Westin Seattle August 19-21

Presented by Robert Koch
Lambda is one of the core services from AWS (Amazon Web Services). Robert will introduce you to the workflow you can use to develop compute functions that usually ties components together whether they&rsquo;re on AWS or not. AWS competitors, Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions, both have similar development workflow and cost as Lambdas.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://deafinthecloud.com/>&copy; Deaf In The Cloud 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
