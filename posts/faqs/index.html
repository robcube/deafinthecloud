Of course, deaf is a word that represent ANY form of hearing loss. We&rsquo;re not going to say every single terminiology representing some form of hearing loss. Besides, we&rsquo;d like our PowerPoint slides simple and brief.</p><p><strong>When will the first meeting happen?</strong>
Hasn&rsquo;t been decided yet. I want to get a general consensus first.</p><p><strong>How will we meet?</strong>
I&rsquo;m actually unsure how this will happen. I figure at a minimum, we&rsquo;d use video conferencing software that is supported by both Windows and Mac browsers allowing optimal participation. Feedback are welcome.</p><p><strong>Why virtually?</strong>
The deaf population isn&rsquo;t robust enough to support a technical user group in one region, except maybe DC/MD/VA.</p><p><strong>Is there a prefered technology?</strong>
No, the user group is technically agnostic. If we were to discuss architecture on the Amazon Web Services platform, there will be analogies on Azure or Google Cloud. If one person talks Python, while another participant prefers nodejs, there&rsquo;ll be similar libraries uses between the two scripting languages.</p><p><strong>Do we have a board or committee?</strong>
Yes, we will implement a board and committee to run the user group and to provide oversight over operations. This is all purely voluntary.</p><p><strong>Who will present?</strong>
You will! As soon you&rsquo;re passionate about something and want to share what you&rsquo;ve learn, please ask to present! We would limit presentations to the length of a classroom hour; 50 minutes. If there is a shorter presentation, that&rsquo;d be great since we&rsquo;d have some time for Q&A.</p><p><strong>How did you make this site?</strong>
<del>I&rsquo;m using <a href=https://blog.getpelican.com/>Pelican</a> which is a Python-based site generator hosted via Github Pages. I hope to move it elsewhere and have it set up with a little more bells and whistles to make it modernized. I&rsquo;m NOT a designer and since the site is functional, I figure it&rsquo;s fine for now until we have volunteers to beautify this. (see, I admit to my shortcomings!)</del></p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://deafinthecloud.com/>&copy; Deaf In The Cloud 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
