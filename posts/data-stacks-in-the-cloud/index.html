Data is ever-increasing and increasingly scattered across multiple app databases and SaaS services, while business teams still expect quick answers to their data questions. Traditional databases are bursting at the seams, and running SQL scripts on these databases to extract-transform-load data & produce business metrics (KPIs) takes up more resources and time. To address these challenges, a data stack ecosystem has sprouted, centered around cloud-based data warehouses (Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery)."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.98.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Data Stacks in the Cloud"><meta property="og:description" content="The talk has adjourned.

Traditional databases are bursting at the seams, and running SQL scripts on these databases to extract-transform-load data & produce business metrics (KPIs) takes up more resources and time. To address these challenges, a data stack ecosystem has sprouted, centered around cloud-based data warehouses (<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/>Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href=https://www.snowflake.com/>Snowflake</a>, <a href=https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/>Google BigQuery</a>). Data loaders interface with them, data transformers convert raw transactional data into analytical data using powerful cloud-based processing, and data reporters rapidly serve data to end users. Best of all, these work on a separate, brand-new layer on top of your existing database infrastructure; no Big Changes needed! I&rsquo;ll give an overview of the different components in the data stack and examples why cloud-based data warehousing is the way to go.</p><p><em>Presented in American Sign Language (ASL).
