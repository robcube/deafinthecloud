Global leading AWS recruiter, Jefferson Frank, recently got in touch with me about an opportunity for an important project they were working on. In response to the Covid-19 crisis, they have collated expert advice from leading AWS Heroes and professionals into an industry whitepaper, of which I am proud to say I am part of.  

The whitepaper covers five common challenges many are struggling with at this moment: cost saving, data security, remote working, growing at scale, and business continuity.

I am honored to have been involved in this project, providing AWS advice to those who need it. I hope my own and my peersâ€™ insight helps those looking for answers at this unprecedented time. 

Please do have a read and share with anyone who would benefit from it: <a href="https://www.jeffersonfrank.com/overcoming-business-challenges-with-aws/">https://www.jeffersonfrank.com/overcoming-business-challenges-with-aws/</a>

Thank you, and stay safe!
