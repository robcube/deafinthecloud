Imagine for a minute you're working with a cloud provider and provisioning features left and right; all of a sudden someone else runs a cloud formation script and broke something! We will do a deep-dive into a typical AWS VPC design and discussing well-architected designs. There'll be a live demostration, and if you have your own AWS account, you can follow along. Of course, many of those tips you will pick up can help you in one of your future exams.
