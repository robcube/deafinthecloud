Presented by <a href="https://deafinthecloud.com/about.html">Robert Koch</a>

Lambda is one of the core services from AWS (Amazon Web Services). Robert will introduce you to the workflow you can use to develop compute functions that usually ties components together whether they're on AWS or not. AWS competitors, Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions, both have similar development workflow and cost as Lambdas. Robert will be using Python to demonstrate. Some code will be from the presentation I did last month with <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbonig">@mattbonig</a>. No prior knowledge of AWS or Lambdas needed.

_Presented in American Sign Language (ASL). We will have a American Sign Language interpreter also available to voice and take in questions from our non-signers audience._
