Speaker
I'm a data scientist at Convo. I first cut my teeth on data programming and statistics while working on my Ph.D. in Educational Neuroscience at Gallaudet University. I used Matlab and R for my dissertation data analysis of infants' brain responses to visual linguistic and non-linguistic patterning. At Convo, I do data engineering, analytics engineering, data science, data analysis, and whatever new neologisms have popped up in the meantime to make sure our data is flowing into the right places and is easily retrieved, understood, and interpreted by different business teams. I live in Edinburgh, Scotland, where my husband and I enjoy the great view of a 1,000-year-old castle from our kitchen window.</p>                </article>
