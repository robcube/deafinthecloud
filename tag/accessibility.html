</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Was about to head to Chicago for the Disability:IN conference, however due to the pandemic, the conference is now held virtually. While the number of speakers and plenaries may not be as great as if it was held in person, it still looks like a great lineup of speakers and companies making their presence known, in other words, holding up their "We're Hiring!" signs.</p>
<p>DAY ONE</p>
<p>Started off with some words of encouragement for companies to join the Disability Equality Index also known as the DEI. The DEI helps you and your company benchmark yourselves and improve ways to include people that you wouldn't normally interact with. After all, to maintain and increase success (it's proven by the way!) as a company, you'd want to avoid groupthink in order to diverisify your strategies and approaches to gain greater returns investing in a broader hiring pool. </p>
<p><img alt="Claudia Gordon in action" src="//deafinthecloud.com/images/claudia-gordon-di.jpg" style="float:left; padding: 4px;height:320px;"></p>
<p>Note: it's really great to see videos including as many disabled people as possible along with their voices: deaf, little people, autistics, amputees, wheelchair users, etc.</p>
<p>Some of the Breakout Sessions ranges from something you're merely curious to those that are a must-watch. For example, the DEI index findings will be skewed towards hiring successes since that is what Disability:IN is all about -- if hiring the disabled AND including them in your conversations isn't successful without governmental assistance then there wouldn't be an organization like Disability:IN. Are you reading between the lines yet? While I'm curious about the numbers coming back from DEI, I want to be more forward-looking and finding ways to magnify voices within our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and increase disability hiring.</p>
<p>Seeing a theme that companies are out there to show they are being good citizens to all, after all they have the resources to be much more inclusive than say small businesses. However, small businesses shouldn't be excused from being more inclusive as corporations &amp; governmental agencies do hire them to do some work. It appears corporations are making an effort to be more representaitve of society as a whole -- we'll see how long that lasts! That's our job as disability advocates, professionally or not.</p>
<p>DAY TWO</p>
<p>Attended a session where the first group talks about the different roles of ERGs and how it can be used to leverage day-to-day business. Interesting stories brought up to rationalize why everyone has to have a seat at the table and with everyone bringing their own selves, we can make the business a better provider and a great place to work!</p>
<p><img alt="Jenny Lay-Flurrie of Microsoft in action" src="//deafinthecloud.com/images/jenny-lay-flurrie-di.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 4px;height:320px;"> One of the highlights of the day is seeing accessibility hero Jenny Lay-Flurrie, the Chief Accessibility Officer at Microsoft, speak. Good to see her live and all companies should aspire to the standards she has established at Microsoft: accessiblity is not optional; run accessibllity like a business.</p>
<p><img alt="Eve Andersson of Google showing off Andorid accessibility tools" src="//deafinthecloud.com/images/eve-andersson-di.png" style="float:left; padding: 4px;height:320px;"> Went through a few talks on how to leverage your ERGs in the company into something for viable that helps employees, the marketplace, and customers alike. It was suggested to focus on the major goals then get down to minor attainable goals to reach the major goal. The culture within the company needs to starting including different viewpoints and overcoming accessibility challenges. Accessibility and diversity are something that is constantly evolving according to the needs of the people building and using their products. </p>
<p>Some advice shared by a group of accessibility leaders -- find allies, champions, management within your organization to help you with fixing accessibility issues. Another person says with the increasing use of Agile processes, nothing is 100% accessible all the time -- things will break, but they will be fixed. Memtioned that we'd get 90-95% accessibility. Third person says that accessibllity is not a nice to have, it's a must have to deliver compelling customer and employee experiences -- it is a moving target. Work with people with disabilities when you design products for accessibility and inclusivity. Disability:IN has a wonderful resource for you if you see a need to set up an accessibility office within your company.</p>
<p>DAY THREE</p>
<p>... tbc ...</p>
<p>CONCLUSION (WIP)</p>
<p>Accessibility to me is a win for all regardless because when companies maneuver to accomodate their employees' needs, it is easy to incorporate the same strategies and methodologies meeting customers' accessibility needs.</p>                </article>
